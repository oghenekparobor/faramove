# Faramove Task


#### About the app
This task is to test accuracy of the replicated design.


#### About the codebase
The project was built with flutter. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.

During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web.

#### Project setup
- Step 1: Clone this repo.
- Step 2: Open project in local machine on either vscode or android studio.
- Step 3: Open terminal on your IDE or external terminal and navigate to project root.
- Step 4: run "flutter pub get" to fetch plugins.
- Step 5: with either your live device connected or emulator running, run "flutter run" to run the project.
- Step 6: Enjoy the view.

#### Design
The inspiration for the design was gotten from this [dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6719179-Photographer-Portfolio-animation) design by [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/voP2ixepbk0AXIHIw5A9Vv/Design-Test-Screens?node-id=1%3A1047&t=cJJ4inNKjEPlSgfp-0)

#### External Libraries
Below are the external libraries used
- [Animate do](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_do)
- [Google font](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)

[Animate do](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_do) is an animation packages inspired by [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). [Animate do](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_do) was used to create simple and fast animation with lesser code. #why_reinvente_the_wheel

[Google font](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) is an official google plugin containing all google's font families. I decided to use it so as to make my pubspec.yaml file neater and fewer lines of code. 

[Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) is a wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable. It was used because it's my favorite of all state management tool.
